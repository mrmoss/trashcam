This is a simple web enabled camera setup made for this camera rig I found in a Goodwill...figured I'd post it?

## Dependencies

Needs opencv and pyserial.

## Parts

Totally non-reproducable parts list:

	- Genius webcam (pretty much the only webcams I buy...)
	- Arduino Nano ($2)
	- Relay (for flashlight, leave this up to you)
	- USB hub (just wanted one wire to the camera, so arduino+webcam are plugged into this)
	- Boost regulator (for flashlight)
	- Super bright LEDs (for flashlight)
	- Gutted industrial webcam enclosure (err...goodluck...)

## Interface

Super terrible interface...but I just want to be done with this project...switch to websockets at some point?

Sorry if my apartment's wall is boring...
